Banking or Financial Systems – Requires a high degree of accuracy, security, and adherence to regulations, which benefits from a structured approach.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Perform Manual Testing:Combine automated testing with manual testing methods like exploratory testing and usability testing to identify edge cases and user experience issues.
Code reviews and walkthroughs – Regularly review code to identify issues early.Ensure that project processes align with established quality standards like ISO 9001 or CMMI.
Automated testing – Perform consistent checks to detect errors in the product. Maintain clear documentation of quality processes to ensure consistency and improve team collaboration.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the project scope is crucial for successful project planning because it sets clear boundaries and outlines the work required to deliver the project. It provides a shared understanding among all stakeholders and helps prevent misunderstandings or unexpected work.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks. It breaks the entire project into sections, making it easier to plan, track, and deliver.
Better Organization - Breaks large, complex projects into smaller, manageable tasks, making it easier to understand and control.
Progress Tracking - provides a clear structure for monitoring progress and identifying potential bottlenecks.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
The benefits of a detailed project are it improves time management and resource allocation, enhances communication and progress tracking, identifies risks and task dependencies, ensures better coordination and meeting deadlines.Gnatt charts assist with visualizing tasks, timelines, and dependencies, tracking progress and identify the critical path, improve resource management and deadline monitoring.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
My software aims to address the challenges students face when trying to find accommodation in Bloemfontein. It’s often difficult for students to find reliable and affordable housing near campus because there isn’t a centralized platform where they can easily view and compare options. Right now, most listings are scattered across different websites or social media, making the process time-consuming and frustrating. Another issue is the lack of easy communication with landlords—students often struggle to get quick responses or clear information. There’s also the risk of running into fake or misleading listings, which can lead to wasted time or even financial loss. These problems matter because finding safe, affordable housing is a huge priority for students, and the process shouldn’t be so stressful. By offering a platform with verified listings, direct messaging, and useful search filters, the app would make it easier and safer for students to find a place that fits their needs and budget.
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clearly defining the problem helps in developing a more effective software solution by providing a focused understanding of what needs to be solved. It allows the development team to identify the root cause of the issue, prioritize essential features, and design a solution that directly addresses user needs. With a clear problem statement, there is less risk of building unnecessary features or wasting time on solutions that don’t solve the core issue. It also improves communication between developers, stakeholders, and users, ensuring everyone is aligned throughout the development process. For example, if the problem is that students struggle to find verified accommodation, the solution can focus on providing a platform with verified listings and direct landlord communication. This clarity leads to better decision-making, efficient resource use, and a software product that effectively meets its goals.
